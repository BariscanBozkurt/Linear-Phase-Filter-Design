Linear Phase FIR filter design for given pass & stop bands and the constraints you might want to 
specify for the optimization problem.

Python class for filter design is shared in LinPhaseFilterDesign.py script. For numerical experiments
and usage check Linear_Phase_Filter_Design_Numerical_Examples.ipynb notebook.

I will provide the mathematical derivations soon.
